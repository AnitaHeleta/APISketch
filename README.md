### 
In this project I had to create a simple, responsive web application that loads dynamic data using JQuery and Javascript to load data from an API and displays it on the front end.

This website utilises National Museum of Australia (NMA)â€™s Web API in order to enable an experience which would allow the user to explore and discover facts about our national aboriginal patrimony.
